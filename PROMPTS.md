1. For my plant-pal app idea what cloudflare services should I use for each component of the app and what command should I use to initialize the overarching project structure? 

2. Help me restructure my durable objects initialization for PlantDO to be in line with convention for defining durable objects on Cloudflare.

3. Help me format my durable object code for a plant object that tracks its features such as plant_type, last_time_watered etc; 

4. How do I add a frontend to my workers project would that be workers pages or would I just add a react project to my project?

5. Give me commands to add Tailwind CSS to my React tsx project.

6. I'm making a plant agent web app that tracks info about your plant and provides information on  how to care for it given prompts. Can you make me a HomePage.tsx, AddPlantPage.tsx, and PlantDetailPage.tsx UI design. Incorporate all the necessary components that these pages may need. Additionally, the project also uses react-router and tailwind css. make sure the pages and components are easily scalable so I can add additional features easily.
